# This is Mi Bot, written using the Pycord library.
#See Development Branch for most up to date commits as main will only be merged when T0 deployment occurs#

### This repo will be replacing the original Mi Bot repo due to the library change. The switch from Hikari to Pycord comes as a result of Hikari's poor documentation and superfluous features.
